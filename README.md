Created using Python 3.12.0
SQLite3 Database Creator/Browser Program For Windows  (English/Spanish)
All Translations are in code and doesn't rely on a Translation import.
The Language can be changed simply by restarting the program after the selection.
Music, Video, Photo and Documents May be attached To The Entry Fields.
If a file is attached and the column definition is assigned TEXT,
double clicking the field will execute the file in it's present location.
If a file is attached and the column definition is assigned BLOB,
the file is copied to the Database Directory and double clicking the
field will execute the file from the Database Directory. The original
file is not bothered. Also you can copy and past Email and Web addresses
into the entry fields as TEXT and double clicking the field will activate
your default email or goto the intended website. A right click on any field
will copy that field content to the clipboard. If a column has all numeric
values, left clicking the field name will display all SQLite3 Aggregate
functions such as minimum value, maximum value, average value and total value.
An external database may be imported if SQLite compatable. When Importing,
The Database Extension is changed to .db3 and the original Database is not
bothered. Any changes to the imported Database does not change the original
Database in any way.
